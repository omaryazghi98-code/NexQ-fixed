# Configuration Guide

NexQ supports multiple STT and LLM providers, configurable audio devices, and local RAG for document context. All settings are accessible via **Settings** (`Ctrl+,`).

## General Settings

![General Settings panel](../../website/public/screenshots/Setting/Setting-General.png)

The General settings panel controls app-wide behavior and preferences. Here you can configure:

- **App behavior** -- startup options, system tray behavior, and window preferences
- **Theme and appearance** -- light/dark mode and visual customization
- **Language** -- interface language selection
- **Update preferences** -- automatic update checks and notification settings
- **Data management** -- storage location and cleanup options

## Speech-to-Text (STT) Providers

![STT Providers settings panel](../../website/public/screenshots/Setting/Setting-STT%20Providers.png)

NexQ uses a two-party audio model: **"You"** (microphone) and **"Them"** (system audio) each have independent STT providers, devices, and mute controls. See the [AI Providers Guide](ai-providers.md) for a detailed comparison of all STT providers and help choosing the right one.

### Web Speech API (Built-in)

- **Setup**: None -- works out of the box

## API Key Management

All API keys are stored securely in **Windows Credential Manager** (not in config files or plain text). NexQ uses the Windows `CredentialManager` API to:

- Store keys: `Settings > [Provider] > API Key > Save`
- Test keys: `Settings > [Provider] > Test Connection`
- Delete keys: `Settings > [Provider] > Remove API Key`

Keys are scoped to your Windows user account and persist across app updates.

## Audio Device Configuration

![Audio and Devices settings panel](../../website/public/screenshots/Setting/Setting-Audio%20and%20Devices.png)

See the [Audio Setup Guide](audio-setup.md) for a comprehensive guide to audio configuration, including device selection, WASAPI loopback details, and troubleshooting common audio issues.

### Microphone ("You")

Select the input device used for capturing your voice. The device picker shows all available input devices with a live audio level meter for verification.

### System Audio ("Them")

Select the output device used to capture remote participants' audio via Windows loopback (WASAPI). This captures whatever audio is playing through that device -- perfect for Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, or any conferencing app.

### Audio Testing

Use the **Test** button next to each device to verify audio levels before starting a meeting. The live peak meter shows real-time audio levels from the selected device.

### Recording

Enable **Recording** to save meeting audio as WAV files alongside the transcript. Recordings are stored in the app data directory and can be played back from the meeting history.

## Context Intelligence (RAG)

![Context Strategy settings panel](../../website/public/screenshots/Setting/Setting-Context%20Strategy.png)

NexQ supports loading documents (PDF, TXT, MD, DOCX) as context for AI responses. When RAG is enabled, the AI uses relevant document chunks to provide more informed answers. See [Using Context Intelligence (RAG)](rag-context.md) for a complete guide to loading documents, best practices by use case, and optimization tips.

### Setup

1. Open Settings > Context
2. Load documents using the file picker
3. Enable RAG and configure the embedding model (requires Ollama with an embedding model like `nomic-embed-text`)
4. Documents are automatically chunked, embedded, and indexed

### Configuration

- **Chunk size and overlap**: Control how documents are split
- **Top-K results**: Number of relevant chunks included in AI context
- **Similarity threshold**: Minimum relevance score for chunk inclusion
- **Search mode**: Semantic, keyword (FTS), or hybrid search

## AI Actions

![AI Actions settings panel](../../website/public/screenshots/Setting/Setting-AI%20Actions.png)

The AI Actions panel configures how NexQ's AI assistance behaves during meetings. Key options include:

- **Action types** -- enable or disable specific AI modes (Assist, What to Say, Shorten, Follow-Up, Recap, Ask Question)
- **Auto-trigger settings** -- configure whether AI suggestions appear automatically based on conversation flow, or only when manually triggered
- **Response style** -- adjust the tone, length, and format of AI responses
- **Context window** -- control how much conversation history is sent to the LLM with each request

## AI Scenarios

![AI Scenarios settings panel](../../website/public/screenshots/Setting/Setting-AI%20Scenarios.png)

AI Scenarios let you switch between pre-configured prompt profiles optimized for different use cases. Each scenario tunes the AI's behavior, tone, and focus:

- **Interview** -- focuses on answer framing, follow-up suggestions, and conversational guidance tailored to job interviews
- **Lecture** -- emphasizes summarization, key concept extraction, and study-relevant assistance
- **Meeting** -- provides general meeting assistance with action items, decisions tracking, and discussion summaries
- **Custom** -- create your own scenario with custom system prompts and behavior settings

Select a scenario in Settings before starting a meeting to get the most relevant AI assistance.

## Confidence Display

![Confidence display settings panel](../../website/public/screenshots/Setting/Setting-Confidence.png)

The Confidence settings control how NexQ displays transcription confidence indicators. Configure:

- **Confidence threshold** -- set the minimum confidence level for displaying transcribed text
- **Visual indicators** -- toggle color-coded confidence highlighting on transcript segments
- **Low-confidence handling** -- choose how to display uncertain transcriptions (dim, strikethrough, or hide)

Higher confidence thresholds filter out uncertain transcriptions, giving you a cleaner transcript at the cost of potentially missing some words.

## Hotkeys

![Hotkey settings panel](../../website/public/screenshots/Setting/Setting-Hotkey.png)

The Hotkey settings let you customize keyboard shortcuts for NexQ's core actions. Configure:

- **Global shortcuts** -- system-wide shortcuts that work even when NexQ is not focused (e.g., start/stop meeting, toggle overlay)
- **Meeting shortcuts** -- shortcuts active during meetings for AI actions
- **Custom key bindings** -- remap any action to your preferred key combination

See [Keyboard Shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md) for a full reference of all available shortcuts and their default bindings.

## Noise Preset

![Noise Preset settings panel](../../website/public/screenshots/Setting/Setting-Noise%20Preset.png)

Noise Preset settings help optimize audio quality for transcription accuracy. Configure:

- **Noise reduction level** -- adjust the aggressiveness of background noise suppression
- **Environment presets** -- select from pre-configured profiles for common environments (quiet room, office, cafe, outdoors)
- **Voice activity detection (VAD)** -- tune sensitivity for detecting when someone is speaking vs. silence
- **Audio enhancement** -- enable or disable audio processing filters that improve STT accuracy

Choose the preset that matches your typical meeting environment for the best transcription results.

## Translation

![Translation settings panel](../../website/public/screenshots/Setting/Setting-Translation.png)

The Translation settings configure real-time translation of meeting transcripts. Key options include:

- **Target language** -- select the language you want transcripts translated into
- **Source language** -- set the expected language of speakers, or use auto-detect
- **Translation provider** -- choose the translation engine (uses the configured LLM provider)
- **Display mode** -- show translations inline alongside the original text, or replace the original text entirely

Translation works in real-time during meetings, providing translated text alongside or in place of the original transcription.
