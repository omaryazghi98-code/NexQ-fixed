# Choosing AI Providers

NexQ uses two types of AI providers: **Speech-to-Text (STT)** for transcription and **Large Language Models (LLM)** for AI assistance. This guide compares all available providers and helps you choose the right ones for your use case.

## STT Provider Comparison

NexQ supports 10 STT providers. Each channel ("You" and "Them") can use a different provider.

| Provider | Type | Cost | Accuracy | Speed | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|-------|----------|
| Web Speech API | Browser | Free | Good | Real-time | Quick setup, long sessions, English |
| Deepgram | Cloud | Pay per use | Excellent | Real-time | Production use, high accuracy |
| Groq Whisper | Cloud | Free tier | Very Good | Very Fast | High accuracy at no cost |
| Whisper (local) | Local | Free | Excellent | Slow | Privacy, offline use |
| ONNX Runtime | Local | Free | Good | Medium | Balanced local option |
| Sherpa-ONNX | Local | Free | Good | Medium | Lightweight local option |
| ORT Streaming | Local | Free | Good | Medium | Streaming local inference |
| Parakeet TDT | Local | Free | Very Good | Medium | High-quality local option |
| Azure Speech | Cloud | Pay per use | Excellent | Real-time | Enterprise, multi-language |
| Windows Native | Local | Free | Fair | Real-time | Offline fallback |

### Choosing an STT Provider

**Start with Web Speech API** if you want zero-setup transcription. It works out of the box, costs nothing, and handles long sessions well.

**Use Deepgram or Groq** if you need higher accuracy. Deepgram's Nova-3 model is the most accurate real-time option. Groq offers excellent accuracy on a free tier.

**Use a local provider** if privacy is critical or you need offline capability. Whisper with the large-v3 model provides the best local accuracy, but requires significant CPU/RAM. Smaller models (tiny, base) are faster but less accurate.

## LLM Provider Comparison

![LLM Providers settings panel](../../website/public/screenshots/Setting/Setting-LLM%20Providers.png)

NexQ supports 8 LLM providers. The LLM powers all AI features: Assist, What to Say, Shorten, Follow-Up, Recap, Ask Question, Meeting Summary, and Action Items.

| Provider | Type | Cost | Speed | Best For |
|----------|------|------|-------|----------|
| Ollama | Local | Free | Varies by model | Privacy, free, offline |
| OpenAI | Cloud | Pay per use | Fast | Best overall quality |
| Anthropic | Cloud | Pay per use | Fast | Nuanced, detailed responses |
| Groq | Cloud | Free tier | Very Fast | Speed, free tier |
| Google Gemini | Cloud | Free tier | Fast | Long context, multimodal |
| LM Studio | Local | Free | Varies by model | Local with GUI model management |
| OpenRouter | Cloud | Pay per use | Varies | Access to hundreds of models |
| Custom | Configurable | Varies | Varies | Self-hosted or custom endpoints |

### Choosing an LLM Provider

**Start with Ollama** if you want free, private AI assistance. Install Ollama, pull a model, and NexQ connects automatically.

**Use OpenAI (GPT-4o)** if you want the best quality suggestions. GPT-4o provides the most accurate and contextually aware responses.

**Use Groq** if you want the fastest responses at no cost. Groq's free tier with Llama models provides fast inference with good quality.

**Use Anthropic (Claude)** if you prefer nuanced, well-reasoned responses, especially for complex or sensitive topics.

## Local vs Cloud Tradeoffs

| Factor | Local (Ollama, Whisper, LM Studio) | Cloud (OpenAI, Deepgram, Groq) |
|--------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Privacy** | Data never leaves your machine | Data sent to provider servers |
| **Cost** | Free | Free tier or pay per use |
| **Setup** | Download and install models | Enter an API key |
| **Accuracy** | Good to Excellent (model dependent) | Excellent |
| **Speed** | Depends on hardware | Consistently fast |
| **Offline** | Works without internet | Requires internet |
| **Resource Usage** | High CPU/RAM during inference | Minimal local resources |

**Recommendation**: Use cloud providers for the best experience. Switch to local if privacy is a hard requirement or you need offline capability.

## Setting Up Ollama (Local LLM)

Ollama is the easiest way to run a local LLM. NexQ auto-detects it on startup.

1. Download and install Ollama from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. Open a terminal and pull a model:
   ```
   ollama pull llama3.2
   ```
3. Verify the model is available:
   ```
   ollama list
   ```
4. Launch NexQ -- it auto-detects Ollama at `http://localhost:11434`
5. Open Settings > LLM to verify the connection and select your model

### Recommended Ollama Models

| Model | Size | Quality | Speed | Use Case |
|-------|------|---------|-------|----------|
| llama3.2 (3B) | ~2 GB | Good | Fast | Quick responses, lower-end hardware |
| llama3.1 (8B) | ~4.7 GB | Very Good | Medium | Best balance of quality and speed |
| mistral (7B) | ~4 GB | Very Good | Medium | Strong general-purpose performance |
| gemma2 (9B) | ~5.4 GB | Very Good | Medium | Good for summarization |

## Setting Up Local Whisper (Local STT)

Local Whisper provides high-accuracy transcription without sending audio to the cloud.

1. Open Settings > Speech-to-Text
2. Select a local engine: **whisper.cpp**, **Sherpa-ONNX**, **ORT Streaming**, or **Parakeet TDT**
3. Click **Download Model** and choose a model size:

| Model | Size | Accuracy | Speed | RAM Required |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| tiny | ~75 MB | Fair | Very Fast | ~1 GB |
| base | ~150 MB | Good | Fast | ~1 GB |
| small | ~500 MB | Good | Medium | ~2 GB |
| medium | ~1.5 GB | Very Good | Slow | ~4 GB |
| large-v3 | ~3 GB | Excellent | Very Slow | ~8 GB |

4. Wait for the download to complete
5. Select the model in the STT provider dropdown
6. Test with the audio level meters to verify transcription

**Tip**: Start with the `small` model for a good balance of accuracy and speed. Move to `large-v3` if accuracy is critical and your hardware can handle it.

## Setting Up Cloud Providers (API Keys)

All cloud providers require an API key. Here is where to get them:

| Provider | Get API Key | Dashboard |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Deepgram | [deepgram.com](https://deepgram.com) | Console > API Keys |
| Groq | [groq.com](https://groq.com) | Console > API Keys |
| OpenAI | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) | API Keys |
| Anthropic | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) | API Keys |
| Google Gemini | [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com) | Get API Key |
| OpenRouter | [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) | Keys |
| Azure Speech | [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) | Cognitive Services > Speech |

### Entering API Keys in NexQ

1. Open Settings (`Ctrl+,`)
2. Navigate to the provider section (STT or LLM)
3. Select the provider from the dropdown
4. Paste your API key into the API Key field
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify
6. The key is stored securely in **Windows Credential Manager** -- not in config files or plain text

### API Key Security

- Keys are stored in Windows Credential Manager, scoped to your Windows user account
- Keys persist across app updates
- To remove a key: Settings > Provider > Remove API Key
- You can also manage keys through Windows Settings > Credential Manager

## Tips

- **Mix and match providers.** You can use different STT providers for "You" and "Them" channels, and a different LLM provider for AI assistance. For example: Web Speech API for mic, Deepgram for system audio, and Ollama for LLM.
- **Start with free options.** Web Speech API (STT) + Ollama (LLM) gives you a fully functional setup at zero cost.
- **Test connection before meetings.** Always click Test Connection after setting up a new provider to catch configuration issues early.
- **Monitor usage for paid providers.** Cloud providers charge per use. Check your dashboard regularly to avoid unexpected costs.
- **Groq offers free tiers for both STT and LLM.** This is the best option if you want cloud accuracy without paying.
